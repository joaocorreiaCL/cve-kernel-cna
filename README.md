# cve-kernel-cna
Collection of python scripts to handle the CVE data from the Linux Kernel CNA.

These scripts are intended to be run in-order:

./scraper.py

Downloads the information about each cve to a directory CVEs\ under the current directory. Will skip existing entries. Needs "requests" and "beautifulsoup4"

./counter.py

Outputs a tally of CVE per LTS version. Reads the json files that were downloaded by the scraper.
