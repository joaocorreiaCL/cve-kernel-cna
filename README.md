# cve-kernel-cna
Collection of python scripts to handle the CVE data from the Linux Kernel CNA.

These scripts are intended to be run in-order:
./scraper.py
Downloads the information about each cve to a directory CVEs\ under the current directory. Will skip existing entries.

./parser.py
Creates a kernel_versions_analysis.csv file containing entries for each "Introduced" and "Fixed" version intervals, for each CVE. The same CVE can appear multiple times, as it affects multiple kernel versions.

./plotter.py
-or-
./plotter-heatmap.py
Generate graphs from the csv data.

These scripts are free to use, and contain bugs. Feel free to do whatever you want with them. No guarantees are implied or explicit, other than its guaranteed to have bugs.
